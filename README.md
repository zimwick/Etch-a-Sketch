# Etch-a-Sketch ðŸŽ¨

Live Demo: [zimwick.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch](https://zimwick.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/)

## Overview

This is a fun, interactive Etch-a-Sketch-inspired web app built using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The purpose of this project was to **practice Flexbox layout techniques** and explore **dynamic DOM manipulation** with JavaScript.

## Features

- ðŸ§± **Responsive Grid** â€“ Users can dynamically change the grid size (up to 100x100).
- ðŸŽ¨ **Color Randomization** â€“ Each cell changes to a random RGB color when hovered.
- ðŸŒ‘ **Progressive Darkening** â€“ Each time a cell is hovered, it becomes gradually darker using increasing opacity.
- ðŸ§ª **Flexbox Practice** â€“ The grid layout is built using CSS Flexbox intentionally, instead of CSS Grid, to strengthen Flexbox understanding.
- âš¡ **Smooth User Interaction** â€“ Lightweight and performant with a clean UI.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event handling)

## How to Use

1. Open the [live site](https://zimwick.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/).
2. Click the "Change Grid Size" button to set a custom grid (e.g., 16 = 16x16).
3. Move your mouse over the grid squares to paint them with random colors.
4. Hover repeatedly to darken squares progressively via opacity.

## Goals & Learning

- Practice and reinforce knowledge of **CSS Flexbox**.
- Gain confidence working with **JavaScript DOM manipulation**.
- Challenge myself by **randomizing color values** and **managing opacity state**.
- Build something visually engaging and interactive without relying on frameworks.
